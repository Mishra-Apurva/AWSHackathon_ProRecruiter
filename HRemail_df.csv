Dear Ms. Essner, Ms. Makansi and Ms. Miller,
I'm an English and history student at Concordia University in Nebraska I'm spending the summer in Missouri and I'm looking for an internship in publishing in St. Louis I know that my good friend
Hannah
has already secured an internship at one of your imprints (Treehouse, I believe). but thought I'd ask anyway: are you in need of a editorial intern this summer?
I
have plenty of experience editing I am the managing editor of my campus newspaper for the upcoming school year, I was the copy editor of the newspaper this past school year, I have edited
my school's creative writing journal for the past two years, I completed an editorial internship at Concordia Publishing House in St. Louis last summer, and I am just starting a remote editorial
internship with the international English honor society Sigma Tau Delta's two journals I have experience working in offices and am familiar with working with others in an office setting as well as
working independently on tasks
As I said, I have a remote internship for the summer and fall, but I'd like to get experience in a publisher's office and with book publishing I follow both Walrus Publishing and Blank State Press on
Twitter, and think I'd be a good fit with either imprint I'd love to get more familiar with the publishing and writing scene in St. Louis, and both imprints look like they're deeply rooted in the
community which is what I'm looking for.
Please see either my resume or my Linkedin profile (https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolinavonkampen) for specific details about my work and publishing experience and please let me know if you
have any questions I'm available to start work on May 25, and I'm available for a phone or Skype interview before then I look forward to hearing from you

Hi Delian,
I've been following you on Twitter for a while and know that one of your portfolio companies is Eight
Sleep. They recently posted a job opening for a Marketing Internship in NY next summer and I am very
interested in it.
I
love Eight Sleep because I am fascinated and excited about the new wave in health technologies that
can really impact people's overall wellbeing. My dad is a doctor so seeing the type of work he is doing
being translated into consumer products is thrilling. Allowing people to take control of their health,
like Eight Sleep is doing for sleep, is something that moves me like no other.
When thinking about their marketing I know that recommendations and review are critical to products
like Eight Sleep's mattresses and pods due to the high commitment and price point. Because of this,
leveraging both micro and macro influencers through broader channels other than Instagram, such as
Youtube, would be a great way to gain consumer trust. I would be able to help Eight Sleep with this
type of marketing strategy and more and would be thrilled to work with a team of their caliber.
Do you know who is best to contact regarding this internship and would you be able to connect me
with them?"

Hi
:
The most important part of my job as a content strategist is that I solve content
problems that are brought to me by others.
And after the lively Q-and-A discussion that followed my
session on
creating a content style guide, I want to be able to do the same thing for you.
But I don't want to forge ahead creating new tools and trainings, assuming I know
exactly what you need.
So, tell me: What content problems keep you up at night?
(I know your time is valuable; thank you in advance for empowering me to do
better work for you.)

Hi Dave,
I couldn't help but notice that you run marketing at Acme Corp. I saw a review you wrote
about how you currently use Widget #2's automation software.
As a Cub's fan, I'm sure you're aware of the marketing machine they've built to get fans and
corporate partners engaged and converted. We were able to help them go from 300 to 30,000
unique site conversions per quarter with our solution.
I'd love a chance to learn about your marketing goals and see if we can get you there faster.

Dear Mr. Walsh:
I
would like to thank you for your decision to hire me as Marketing Manager at Excel Partners. I have always
held your organization in great esteem, as I am in complete awe of the way you have made a humble
beginning into such an amazing corporate existence.
Unfortunately, I have no choice but to decline this job offer at this point in time, due to some personal
reasons. While nothing would please me more than becoming part of an organization that I look up to so
much, I cannot do justice to the work when I am not fully in the right frame of mind. During the past few
weeks, I have lost much in terms of health and have not been able to recuperate. I believe that joining a new
organization at this stage will not be fair to it, as I will not be able to contribute energetically.
I hope that you find someone to hire as a marketing manager of Excel Partners on an immediate basis, so
that your work does not suffer. If this position isn't filled 3 weeks from now, I will contact you after
reassessing my personal problems. Thank you for your trust in my abilities to do the job. I hope to remain in

See? Short, to the point, and polite. That's exactly what the not-for-profit you interviewed
at wants to hear.
Finally, you should not send any more correspondence to the employer if they tell you not to
call for updates on the job. If you really want to kill your chances of getting the job of your
dreams, there is no better way than bombarding the organization with e-mails. It's sort of

I
have plenty of experience editing I am the managing editor of my campus newspaper for the upcoming school year, I was the copy editor of the newspaper this past school year, I have edited
my school's creative writing journal for the past two years, I completed an editorial internship at Concordia Publishing House in St. Louis last summer, and I am just starting a remote editorial
internship with the international English honor society Sigma Tau Delta's two journals I have experience working in offices and am familiar with working with others in an office setting as well as
working independently on tasks
As I said, I have a remote internship for the summer and fall, but I'd like to get experience in a publisher's office and with book publishing I follow both Walrus Publishing and Blank State Press on
Twitter, and think I'd be a good fit with either imprint I'd love to get more familiar with the publishing and writing scene in St. Louis, and both imprints look like they're deeply rooted in the

Hi Delian,
I've been following you on Twitter for a while and know that one of your portfolio companies is Eight
Sleep. They recently posted a job opening for a Marketing Internship in NY next summer and I am very
interested in it.
I
love Eight Sleep because I am fascinated and excited about the new wave in health technologies that
can really impact people's overall wellbeing. My dad is a doctor so seeing the type of work he is doing
being translated into consumer products is thrilling. Allowing people to take control of their health,
like Eight Sleep is doing for sleep, is something that moves me like no other.
When thinking about their marketing I know that recommendations and review are critical to products
like Eight Sleep's mattresses and pods due to the high commitment and price point. Because of this,
leveraging both micro and macro influencers through broader channels other than Instagram, such as
Youtube, would be a great way to gain consumer trust. I would be able to help Eight Sleep with this
type of marketing strategy and more and would be thrilled to work with a team of their caliber.
Do you know who is best to contact regarding this internship and would you be able to connect me
with them?"

I

Unfortunately, I have no choice but to decline this job offer at this point in time, due to some personal

See? Short, to the point, and polite. That's exactly what the not-for-profit you interviewed
at wants to hear.
Finally, you should not send any more correspondence to the employer if they tell you not to
call for updates on the job. If you really want to kill your chances of getting the job of your
dreams, there is no better way than bombarding the organization with e-mails. It's sort of
like dating that way; you don't want to come off as too aggressive or it will seriously turn off
the prospective employer."

Dear Mr. Jefferson,
Thank you very much for your time yesterday-it was a pleasure speaking

I especially enjoyed discussing your need for someone who can create value

Over the last few years, I've encountered many of the same roadblocks we
